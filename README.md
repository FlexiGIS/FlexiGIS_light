FlexiGIS-Light is a sub module of FlexiGIS, which is free and open source GIS-based plattform. The extracted urban energy infrustructure are based mainly on OpenStreetMap data.

## System requirements
FlexiGIS is developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04.6). The tools and software used in FlexiGIS and their versions are listed in the following:

* Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS, Release: 16.04, Codename: xenial
* PostgreSQL version: 11.2 (64-bit)
* PostGIS version: 1.5.3
* osmosis version: 0.44.1
* osm2pgsql version: 0.88.1 (64bit id space)
* GNU Make version: 4.2.1
* Python: 3.6.7
* GNU bash: 4.3.48(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)


PostgreSQL: To install PostgreSQL, refer to the webpage: http://www.postgresql.org/. Please note that you need at least the version or higher to run FlexiGIS.

Osmosis: To use Osmosis, unzip the distribution (which can be obtain from the webpage: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis) in the location of your choice. On unix/linux systems, make the bin/osmosis script executable (ie. chmod u+x osmosis). If desired, create a symbolic link to the osmosis script somewhere on your path (eg. ln -s appdir/bin/osmosis ~/bin/osmosis).

osm2pgsql: Instruction are available on how to download and install osm2pgsql for Linux systems on the webpage: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql.

Python: Ensure you can run python (with version 3 and above) on your OS. Python can be downloaded following this link https://www.python.org/downloads/ or Anaconda distro from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ .

## Getting Started
To use the FlexiGIS-Light model download the *FlexiGIS_light* code and data folder as a zip file or clone the repository from the *FlexiGIS_light* GitHub repo. After downloading the FlexiGIS-Light code, unzip the folder FlexiGIS_light in the location of your choice. The file structure of the *FlexiGIS_light* code is as follows:

* FlexiGIS_light
    * ├── code
    * ├── data
    * │   ├── 01_raw_input_data
    * │   ├── 02_urban_output_data
    * │   ├── 03_urban_energy_requirements
    * │   └── 04_Visualisation
    * ├── doc
    * │   ├── AUTHOR
    * │   ├── BSD License.pdf
    * │   ├── COPYING
    * │   ├── LICENSE
    * │   ├── README.md
    * └── requirements.txt

  
## Installation
After making sure all system requirements are satisfied, create a Python virtual environment where the required python dependencies can be installed using pip. Python virtual
environment can be created by following the steps from https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/ . After creating a python virtual environment, install
the required python dependencies by running:

activate the virtual environment

```
source virtual_env_name/bin/activate
```
cd into the unzipped or cloned FlexiGIS directory

```
cd ../FlexiGIS_light
```

install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### FlexiGIS directory description

`code:` The folder code contains a "makefile" for running the FlexiGIS-Light model and the configuration file "config.mk". The "config.mk" file contains different parameters necessary
 to run the FlexiGIS-Light model.

`data:` The folder data contains all the data needed and generated by the FlexiGIS-Light code. The FlexiGIS-Light code is provided with the input and output data of the FlexiGIS model. The folder data contains 4 sub folders, which are introduced as follows:

The folder *01_raw_input_data* contains the file Berlin.poly, which is used when filtering the OSM planet data of Berlin. This is achieved by Osmosis and executed by *"make filter_OSM"*. The OSM planet data is filtered spatially to include Berlin. This folder should contain the OSM planet data file. It is not included in the present distribution of FlexiGIS-Light because of its size. It can be downloaded from: http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/misc/openstreetmap/planet.openstreetmap.org/planet. The the resulting filtered OSM power data is stored in folder *01_raw_input_data*. An example is provided with the FlexiGIS-Light code as file Berlin-latest.osm.pbf.

Urban style data "urban.style", Weather data "weather-data.csv", Standard load profile data "SLP.csv" which are all input data are also saved in the *01_raw_input_data* directory.

The resulting abstracted urban infrastructure based on landuse in this case highway: point (e.g street light), line (e.g motorway), and polygons (e.g roundabouts) are extracted and saved as csv data files in the *02_urban_output_data* directory.

In *03_urban_energy_requirements* directory, the calculated streetlight load timeseries for the urban infrastructure is stored as a csv. Plots of the abstracted urban infrastructure and load timeseries are saved in folder *04_visualization*.

`doc:` A primary user guide of the FlexiGIS code and model  is provided in the folder doc.

## Running FlexiGIS

To run FlexiGIS execute the following steps:

1. Download the FlexiGIS folder and unzip it in the location of your choice.

2. Go to the folder code, check the parameters in config.mk file.

The available makefile options are:

a. `make all`

b. `make download`

c. `make filter_data`

d. `make export_data`

e. `make abstract_data`

f. `make streetlight_load`

g. `make drop_database`

3. After running the FlexiGIS-Light model using the makefile, the resulting streetlight load profiles, urban infrastructure data are stored as .csv data in folder *../data/02_urban_output_data* and *../data/03_urban_energy_requirements*.

## Documentation

*still ongoing*

A detailed documentation of the FlexiGIS code  is available in the user guide (in folder doc).
The user guide includes detailed information about the FlexiGIS code structure, how to run the FlexiGIS model. Moreover, the user guide includes information about the simplifications and assumptions of the FlexiGIS model as well as information about how the OSM data are used.
